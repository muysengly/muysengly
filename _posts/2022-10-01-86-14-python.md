A Python program can handle date and time in several ways. Converting between date formats is a common chore for computers. Python's time and calendar modules help track dates and times.

## What is Tick?

Time intervals are floating-point numbers in units of seconds. Particular instants in time are expressed in seconds since 00:00:00 hrs January 1, 1970(epoch).

There is a popular **time** module available in Python which provides functions for working with times, and for converting between representations. The function _time.time()_ returns the current system time in ticks since 00:00:00 hrs January 1, 1970(epoch).

## Example

[ Live Demo](http://tpcg.io/AiJa9O)

```
#!/usr/bin/python
import time;  # This is required to include time module.

ticks = time.time()
print "Number of ticks since 12:00am, January 1, 1970:", ticks
```

This would produce a result something as follows −

```
Number of ticks since 12:00am, January 1, 1970: 7186862.73399
```

Date arithmetic is easy to do with ticks. However, dates before the epoch cannot be represented in this form. Dates in the far future also cannot be represented this way - the cutoff point is sometime in 2038 for UNIX and Windows.

## What is TimeTuple?

Many of Python's time functions handle time as a tuple of 9 numbers, as shown below −

| Index |      Field       |                  Values                   |
| :---: | :--------------: | :---------------------------------------: |
|   0   |   4-digit year   |                   2008                    |
|   1   |      Month       |                  1 to 12                  |
|   2   |       Day        |                  1 to 31                  |
|   3   |       Hour       |                  0 to 23                  |
|   4   |      Minute      |                  0 to 59                  |
|   5   |      Second      |    0 to 61 (60 or 61 are leap-seconds)    |
|   6   |   Day of Week    |           0 to 6 (0 is Monday)            |
|   7   |   Day of year    |           1 to 366 (Julian day)           |
|   8   | Daylight savings | -1, 0, 1, -1 means library determines DST |

The above tuple is equivalent to **struct_time** structure. This structure has following attributes −

| Index | Attributes |                  Values                   |
| :---: | :--------: | :---------------------------------------: |
|   0   |  tm_year   |                   2008                    |
|   1   |   tm_mon   |                  1 to 12                  |
|   2   |  tm_mday   |                  1 to 31                  |
|   3   |  tm_hour   |                  0 to 23                  |
|   4   |   tm_min   |                  0 to 59                  |
|   5   |   tm_sec   |    0 to 61 (60 or 61 are leap-seconds)    |
|   6   |  tm_wday   |           0 to 6 (0 is Monday)            |
|   7   |  tm_yday   |           1 to 366 (Julian day)           |
|   8   |  tm_isdst  | -1, 0, 1, -1 means library determines DST |

## Getting current time

To translate a time instant from a _seconds since the epoch_ floating-point value into a time-tuple, pass the floating-point value to a function (e.g., localtime) that returns a time-tuple with all nine items valid.

[ Live Demo](http://tpcg.io/T9ZAOe)

```
#!/usr/bin/python
import time;

localtime = time.localtime(time.time())
print "Local current time :", localtime
```

This would produce the following result, which could be formatted in any other presentable form −

```
Local current time : time.struct_time(tm_year=2013, tm_mon=7,
tm_mday=17, tm_hour=21, tm_min=26, tm_sec=3, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=198, tm_isdst=0)
```

## Getting formatted time

You can format any time as per your requirement, but simple method to get time in readable format is asctime() −

[ Live Demo](http://tpcg.io/Pn2IUS)

```
#!/usr/bin/python
import time;

localtime = time.asctime( time.localtime(time.time()) )
print "Local current time :", localtime
```

This would produce the following result −

```
Local current time : Tue Jan 13 10:17:09 2009
```

## Getting calendar for a month

The calendar module gives a wide range of methods to play with yearly and monthly calendars. Here, we print a calendar for a given month ( Jan 2008 ) −

[ Live Demo](http://tpcg.io/R9vlY8)

```
#!/usr/bin/python
import calendar

cal = calendar.month(2008, 1)
print "Here is the calendar:"
print cal
```

This would produce the following result −

```
Here is the calendar:
January 2008
Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su
1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
14 15 16 17 18 19 20
21 22 23 24 25 26 27
28 29 30 31
```

## The _time_ Module

There is a popular **time** module available in Python which provides functions for working with times and for converting between representations. Here is the list of all available methods −

Let us go through the functions briefly −

There are following two important attributes available with time module −

| Sr.No. |                                                                         Attribute with Description                                                                         |
| :----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|   1    | **time.timezone**Attribute time.timezone is the offset in seconds of the local time zone (without DST) from UTC (>0 in the Americas; <=0 in most of Europe, Asia, Africa). |
|   2    |         **time.tzname**Attribute time.tzname is a pair of locale-dependent strings, which are the names of the local time zone without and with DST, respectively.         |

## The _calendar_ Module

The calendar module supplies calendar-related functions, including functions to print a text calendar for a given month or year.

By default, calendar takes Monday as the first day of the week and Sunday as the last one. To change this, call calendar.setfirstweekday() function.

Here is a list of functions available with the _calendar_ module −

| Sr.No. |                                                                                                                           Function with Description                                                                                                                            |
