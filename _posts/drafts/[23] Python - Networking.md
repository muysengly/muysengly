# Python - Network Programming

------

Python provides two levels of access to network services. At a low level, you can access the basic socket support in the underlying operating system, which allows you to implement clients and servers for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.

Python also has libraries that provide higher-level access to specific application-level network protocols, such as FTP, HTTP, and so on.

This chapter gives you understanding on most famous concept in Networking - Socket Programming.

## What is Sockets?

Sockets are the endpoints of a bidirectional communications channel. Sockets may communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different continents.

Sockets may be implemented over a number of different channel types: Unix domain sockets, TCP, UDP, and so on. The *socket* library provides specific classes for handling the common transports as well as a generic interface for handling the rest.

Sockets have their own vocabulary −

| Sr.No. |                      Term & Description                      |
| :----: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|   1    | **Domain**The family of protocols that is used as the transport mechanism. These values are constants such as AF_INET, PF_INET, PF_UNIX, PF_X25, and so on. |
|   2    | **type**The type of communications between the two endpoints, typically SOCK_STREAM for connection-oriented protocols and SOCK_DGRAM for connectionless protocols. |
|   3    | **protocol**Typically zero, this may be used to identify a variant of a protocol within a domain and type. |
|   4    | **hostname**The identifier of a network interface −A string, which can be a host name, a dotted-quad address, or an IPV6 address in colon (and possibly dot) notationA string "<broadcast>", which specifies an INADDR_BROADCAST address.A zero-length string, which specifies INADDR_ANY, orAn Integer, interpreted as a binary address in host byte order. |
|   5    | **port**Each server listens for clients calling on one or more ports. A port may be a Fixnum port number, a string containing a port number, or the name of a service. |

## The *socket* Module

To create a socket, you must use the *socket.socket()* function available in *socket* module, which has the general syntax −

```
s = socket.socket (socket_family, socket_type, protocol=0)
```

Here is the description of the parameters −

- **socket_family** − This is either AF_UNIX or AF_INET, as explained earlier.
- **socket_type** − This is either SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM.
- **protocol** − This is usually left out, defaulting to 0.

Once you have *socket* object, then you can use required functions to create your client or server program. Following is the list of functions required −

## Server Socket Methods

| Sr.No. |                     Method & Description                     |
| :----: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|   1    | **s.bind()**This method binds address (hostname, port number pair) to socket. |
|   2    |  **s.listen()**This method sets up and start TCP listener.   |
|   3    | **s.accept()**This passively accept TCP client connection, waiting until connection arrives (blocking). |

## Client Socket Methods

| Sr.No. |                     Method & Description                     |
| :----: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|   1    | **s.connect()**This method actively initiates TCP server connection. |

## General Socket Methods

| Sr.No. |               Method & Description               |
| :----: | :----------------------------------------------: |
|   1    |   **s.recv()**This method receives TCP message   |
|   2    |  **s.send()**This method transmits TCP message   |
|   3    | **s.recvfrom()**This method receives UDP message |
|   4    | **s.sendto()**This method transmits UDP message  |
|   5    |      **s.close()**This method closes socket      |
|   6    |  **socket.gethostname()**Returns the hostname.   |

## A Simple Server

To write Internet servers, we use the **socket** function available in socket module to create a socket object. A socket object is then used to call other functions to setup a socket server.

Now call **bind(hostname, port)** function to specify a *port* for your service on the given host.

Next, call the *accept* method of the returned object. This method waits until a client connects to the port you specified, and then returns a *connection* object that represents the connection to that client.

```
#!/usr/bin/python           # This is server.py file

import socket               # Import socket module

s = socket.socket()         # Create a socket object
host = socket.gethostname() # Get local machine name
port = 12345                # Reserve a port for your service.
s.bind((host, port))        # Bind to the port

s.listen(5)                 # Now wait for client connection.
while True:
   c, addr = s.accept()     # Establish connection with client.
   print 'Got connection from', addr
   c.send('Thank you for connecting')
   c.close()                # Close the connection
```

## A Simple Client

Let us write a very simple client program which opens a connection to a given port 12345 and given host. This is very simple to create a socket client using Python's *socket* module function.

The **socket.connect(hosname, port )** opens a TCP connection to *hostname* on the *port*. Once you have a socket open, you can read from it like any IO object. When done, remember to close it, as you would close a file.

The following code is a very simple client that connects to a given host and port, reads any available data from the socket, and then exits −

```
#!/usr/bin/python           # This is client.py file

import socket               # Import socket module

s = socket.socket()         # Create a socket object
host = socket.gethostname() # Get local machine name
port = 12345                # Reserve a port for your service.

s.connect((host, port))
print s.recv(1024)
s.close()                     # Close the socket when done
```

Now run this server.py in background and then run above client.py to see the result.

```
# Following would start a server in background.
$ python server.py & 

# Once server is started run client as follows:
$ python client.py
```

This would produce following result −

```
Got connection from ('127.0.0.1', 48437)
Thank you for connecting
```
